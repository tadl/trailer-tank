== Trailer Tank

Trailer Tank is a Ruby on Rails web app that:

* Lets users login via Google Apps Oauth

* Links EvergreenILS record ids with Youtube videos

* Returns youtube video ids in a JSON response when queried with a record id

* Allows for editing and maintenance

* Displays a leaderboard

At this time the project will be designed to work just with Traverse Area District Library's Evergreen ILS.
